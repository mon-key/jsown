Each spec in SPECS should contain a list with the first element being the string

value to which the key should be set.

It is heavily related to jsown-object, which fills in an empty object.

eg: 
 
 \(extend-js \(empty-object\)
   \(\"kind\" \"onyx.Groupbox\"\)
   \(\"components\" \(list \(new-js
                         \(\"content\" \"Hello World\"\)
                         \(\"tag\" \"h1\"\)\)
                       \(new-js
                         \(\"tag\" \"p\"\)
                         \(\"content\" \"This is jsown talkin!\"\)\)\)\)\)
